## Caesar Cipher
Implemented a Caesar cipher that takes in a string and the shift factor 
and then outputs the modified string using a right shift.

## Sub strings
Implemented a method that takes a word as the first argument
and then an array of valid substrings (e.g., dictionary) as the second argument that
returns a hash listing of each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and 
how many times it was found.

## Stock picker
Implemented a method that takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day.
It returns a pair of days representing the best day to buy and to sell.
